        <p>Guinea pigs need a spacious cage with good ventilation. Provide a hiding spot and soft bedding material like hay or fleece.</p>
        <p>A balanced diet includes fresh hay, vegetables, and high-quality guinea pig pellets. Avoid giving them high-calcium vegetables.</p>
        <p>Guinea pigs groom themselves, but you should also help by brushing their fur regularly. Trim their nails when necessary.</p>
        <p>Guinea pigs love to run and play. Provide them with a safe and secure area to explore outside the cage.</p>
