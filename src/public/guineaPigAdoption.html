        <p>According to Guinea Dad, pet stores can be a convenient option for getting guinea pigs. They often have a variety of breeds available, and you can interact with the guinea pigs before making a decision.</p>
        <p>Some guinea pigs come in sick at the pet store. Some have even what is called ringworm, which is a circular spot that causes intense itching.</p>
        <p>Some pet stores accidentally misgender their guinea pigs. Sometimes, it could lead to unwanted guinea pig pregnancies and you could end up having more piggies in your cage. This will be told in another page.</p>
