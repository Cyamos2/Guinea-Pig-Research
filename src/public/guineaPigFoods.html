        <p>Guinea pigs enjoy a variety of foods, including fresh hay, vegetables, and high-quality guinea pig pellets. However, avoid giving them foods that are high in calcium.</p>
        <p>Safe vegetables for guinea pigs include leafy greens, bell peppers, and carrots. Always introduce new foods gradually to prevent digestive issues.</p>
        <p>Provide fresh water at all times and monitor your guinea pig's weight and overall health. Consult with a veterinarian for specific dietary recommendations.</p>
